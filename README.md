A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Following are submitted:
- README.md
- tidy data set tidy_data.txt 
The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data.txt, and uploaded in the project's form
- one R script called run_analysis.R
It contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
